- **adapters**: This folder contains modules that provide a standardized interface to interact with external systems or APIs. Adapters are responsible for adapting responses from external systems or APIs to a format that can be easily consumed by the application. This helps to separate concerns and allows for easy swapping of external systems or APIs without affecting the core application logic.

- **services**: This folder contains modules that handle the core business logic of the application. Services use **adapters** to interact with external systems or APIs and process data as needed to provide functionality to the application.

- **main**: This folder contains files related to the main process, such as Electron configuration files or main process scripts.

- **container.js**: This file sets up the application's dependency injection container. It registers the necessary adapters and services and provides a standardized way to initialize and access them throughout the application.

## Adapters

Adapters provide a standardized interface to interact with external systems or APIs. They are responsible for adapting responses from external systems or APIs to a format that can be easily consumed by the application. This helps to separate concerns and allows for easy swapping of external systems or APIs without affecting the core application logic.

In this project, we have a `WeatherApiAdapter` that interacts with an external weather API to retrieve weather data. The adapter processes the API response and returns a standardized format that can be easily consumed by the application.

## Services

Services handle the core business logic of the application. They use adapters to interact with external systems or APIs and process data as needed to provide functionality to the application.

In this project, we have a `WeatherService` that uses the `WeatherApiAdapter` to retrieve weather data and provides a method to retrieve the current temperature in a specified location.

## Container.js

`container.js` sets up the application's dependency injection container. It registers the necessary adapters and services and provides a standardized way to initialize and access them throughout the application.

The container is initialized in the main process and is then passed to the renderer process via IPC. This allows the renderer process to access the registered adapters and services and use them as needed.
